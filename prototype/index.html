            <p>These videos show all of the parts of my prototype that I mocked up. It follows the same task format that
                I used in my user testing.</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Admin Functions</strong>: request admin access and change role groupings such that the 23s
                    are considered alumni instead of current students</li>
                <li><strong>Creating Chats as Admin</strong>: create a new public chat with only the 23s and 24s</li>
                <li><strong>Event RSVP</strong>: RSVP yes to an Iftar event</li>
            </ol>

            The improvements that I made since my paper prototype are:
            <ol>
                <li>More documentation: shows what the private/locked roles are, the difference between private and
                    public chats, and that access to private roles must be requested</li>
                <li>The look of roles is consistent with filters/attributes that can be drag and dropped/clicked to be
                    added and removed from different groupings. Similarly the look of the MSA/BSA buttons look more like
                    filter buttons than buttons that take you to settings.</li>
                <li>Separated groupings from roles and made buttons more clear as to whether they refered to roles or groupings</li>
            </ol>
